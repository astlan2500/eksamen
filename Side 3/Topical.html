    <h1>Why we prototype</h1>
    <p>There are many great reasons to make prototypes and to include them early and often in your process, and the four main points I’ll cover are as follows: to understand, to communicate, to test and improve, and to advocate . Each of these is similar, but has a unique twist to why pro- totypes are valuable and why you should include them at different parts of your design process .</p>
    <h2>To Understand</h2>
    <p>Prototyping is a great way to not only understand the problem you’re currently trying to solve, but to illuminate alternative problems you should solve instead . This process is called problem discovery, and it can help you find the root cause of your user’s pain, which might be dif- ferent than your originally assumed user problem . It’s helpful to do problem discovery, through exploratory research and prototyping, early in your process because the further along you are in development, the more difficult and expensive (in time and money) it will be to change directions (Figure 2-1) . You will find it easier to pivot as early as you can so that you’re on the right track for the product .</p>

    <p>For example, Segway saw an opportunity area between pedestrian walking and car driving, but didn’t spend adequate time research- ing and validating their problem space (Figure 2-2) . They decided to address this problem with a stand-upon solution, but when it hit the market, there were too many assumptions they had already made that were not true, including: access to usable infrastructure, non-rainy climates, no need for multiple passengers, and viability at their price point . If they had done initial research and prototyping with real users, they could have pivoted to an alternative problem and really hit the solu- tion out of the park .</p>
    <h3>ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS</h3>
    <p>In addition to understanding the problem, you can explore and under- stand lots of different ways to solve the problem through drawing and prototyping . It’s easy to get stuck in your head thinking about a single solution you’ve decided to pursue . Early on, you should try out as many variations that you can think of, instead of sticking with your first orig- inal idea (Figure 2-3) . The best way to explore is to make quick proto- types of all the different ways to solve the user’s problem . Then you can conduct task-based tests or A/B tests to compare two or more versions of the same interaction to see which one performs better . Having a user interact with your idea will give you valuable support or invalida- tion for your current solution or current definition of the problem . You can then move forward with more confidence in your idea and choice of direction .</p>
